# Phase-1-Moringa-Project
# The Project is web application that retrieves and displays voting data from the US Congress using the ProPublica Congress API. 

## The functionality of the application is as follows:

1. Fetches voting data for recent bills in the House of Representatives and displays the bill number, sponsor ID, title, latest action, and vote counts by party in a table.

2. Allows the user to navigate between different bills using previous and next buttons.

3. Allows the user to search for a specific bill by number.

4. Provides a visual representation of the status of each bill using an image of either "Passed" or "Rejected".

5. Fetches voting data for a specific vote in the Senate and displays the vote positions of each member in a list.

#
The application is written in JavaScript and uses the Fetch API to make requests to the ProPublica Congress API. The data is then displayed using HTML and CSS. The application also uses event listeners to handle user input such as clicking on buttons and submitting search queries.
